			<strong>This edition of the Olympian News deals with 5 ways to have a higher chance of winning Capture the Flag</strong>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			Hey there demigods! We at Olympians News are back with the latest edition of what’s going on in Camp. This time, we’re going to be looking at a few shady (and some not-so-shady) tips and tricks to win Capture the Flag. So let’s get right into it!<p>

<ol>
<b><li>Bribe the referee</li></b>
This is one of the most commonly used tricks. You’d probably see this at least once every match. You can butter up the ref by calling them an ‘<i>angel</i>’- when they are NOT- or a ‘pro gamur’ (emphasis on <i>gamur</i>) or even start talking all about their favorite movie (*cough* the <i>Bee movie</i> is a good one *cough*). However, most referees do not accept bribes, and there is nothing much you can do to change their minds. Which is why we have so many more devious options!
<b><li>Sabotage the opposing team</li></b>
You win CtF by default if your opposing team doesn’t show up. Enough said >;)
<b><li>Use pumpkins</li></b>
Pumpkins are surprisingly effective at slowing down opponents to reclaim your flag, as famously shown in the Nature against Might match. You will find a lot of them randomly scattered throughout Camp, thanks to Halloween, so make sure you use them wisely! Nothing like a good ole’ Pumpkin to the face to distract your opponent and win CtF!
<b><li>Use the fan cam to your advantage</li></b>
Nothing like proposing to the love of your life on fan cam!
While this will make sure that your proposal does not go unnoticed, it has <strike>an even greater</strike> another advantage- while everyone is gushing about how sweet you and your significant other are, your teammates can use the distraction to win! Talk about capturing flags and hearts!<br>
This method was seen recently in the Nature versus Mystery Cup, but well, it was a completely sweet occasion and no one used the distraction because everyone was gushing over the sweet engaged couple. But still- it’s a good idea!
<b><li>Just spam Bas</li></b>
Basilio Copalla, the <strike>eccentric</strike> scary Greek and Roman heroes teacher at Camp, is a CtF legend. He is the answer to all CtF questions, and when in doubt, just spam Bas. More often than not, you will get the answer <b>wrong</b>, but hey, Bas is more powerful than you think. He’s the bast.
</ol>
So there you have it, five ways to improve on Ctf, whether you’re playing or simply there to support your team or distract the opponents. Make sure you check out the <a href = "https://worldofolympians.com/quidditch">CtF schedule</a> so that you’re there for all the games! All the best to all clusters <strike>most of all Might</strike> and happy Halloween!<p>

Yours from the CtF field,<p>

Asher Matthews<p>
